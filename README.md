Why I chose this project?
a. It seemed like a simple enough project that could be done using only javascript, which meant
that I could host it on Github Pages.
b. I use pomodoro timers quite a lot to keep focus while studying, and while working on my own
personal projects. As such, I thought it'd be good to make one myself.
c. The pomodoro timer I usually used has on occasion warned me about using adblockers, and an
(admittedly rather brief) search for alternatives on the internet found no good web or mobile-based
alternative.
d. It is a project that has actual practical use-cases.
